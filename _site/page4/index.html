    <p><em>A private crypto-currency with amazing fungibility and protocol level mixing</em> just about sums up the relatively new crypto-currency; Monero, created in April 2014.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="crypto-currency-adoption">Crypto-currency adoption</h3>
<p>While many people have heard of Bitcoin, (and some of those have heard of Dogecoin or Litecoin) most people have never heard of Monero. Some people complain about missing the Bitcoin boat. I personally don’t think that boat has sailed yet (though there’d be many who’d disagree). You’re here reading about Monero before it’s in the news so if you buy some at these price levels you’ll be an early adopter. I do think Monero is going to be a hot topic in world news due to its high degree of decentralisation and anonymity.</p>

<h3 id="bitcoin">Bitcoin</h3>

<p>Bitcoin is a liberating tool and extremely interesting social experiment in money. However, there are some difficulties using it as a medium of exchange:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Full traceability is bad news for proprietary businesses (competitors can glean information using blockchain analysis).</li>
  <li>Uncertainty over block size consensus.</li>
  <li>People explicitly seeking privacy usually mix coins, losing value in fees or fraud.</li>
  <li>Poor fungibility - exchanges can confiscate your bitcoins if they suspect they were involved in criminal transactions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like Bitcoin, Monero has a similar amount in total supply (18.4 million) of which around 10.2 million are already generated. It’s worth pointing out that Monero’s supply differs to Bitcoin because it has continual inflation (less than 1% per year) when the 18.4 million mark is reached (2022).</p>

<p>Another small difference is that Monero’s reward is smoothly varying with the difficulty retargeting at every block.</p>

<p>Unlike Bitcoin however, Monero is not traceable by default and block size is dynamically adjusted. The details of how this works exactly will be the subject of another post.</p>

<h3 id="centralisation">Centralisation</h3>

<p>Bitcoin is mined these days mostly by large companies - the majority of which are mining in China because of the cheap electricity, access to mining equipment and proximity to fabrication houses (Taiwan). This is disconcerting when Satoshi’s original vision was to have a <em>decentralised, peer to peer digital cash system</em>.</p>

<p>With Monero it is not only <abbr title="Application Specific Integrated Circuit">ASIC</abbr> resistant, but also <abbr title="Graphics Processing Unit">GPU</abbr> resistant too - meaning people with ordinary computers can participate in securing the network and be rewarded for doing so. Solo mining is even available - with the reward at around 7.8 <abbr title="crypto-currency unit code for Monero">XMR</abbr> (around $2.92 USD) don’t expect to hit the jackpot anytime soon. The difficulty right now is high enough that an ordinary computer would only find a block once every 3 months. However, in the future it could be worth many multiples if Monero follows a similar trajectory that Bitcoin once did.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-i-make-money-with-monero">How can I make money with Monero?</h3>

<p>Looking back over the last few years, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/29/bitcoin-forgotten-currency-norway-oslo-home">some people made an absolute fortune</a> with Bitcoin <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/blog/2013/jul/01/bitcoin-virtual-fortune-crypto-currency">simply mining</a> or buying small amounts if it when it was worth next to nothing.</p>

<p>History tends to repeat itself. Early investors in the crypto-currency space are well positioned in the events of the global economy faltering, a bank collapsing, a stock market crash or even if none of the above happens and Internet trade just increases. Monero is worth around 37.5 cents at the time of writing. If more people value private digital cash in the future the value will increase - how much it increases by is anyone’s guess! Monero holds a number of advantages over Bitcoin and as more people discover this, its market value should increase.</p>
