##If cash were banned...

Imagine a world where all transactions were between known identified parties. A world where cash had been successfully replaced by banking products that followed Know Your Customer procedures diligently. The argument for this utopia goes that there'd be much less crime in general, less fraud, tax evasion, illicit drugs & other illegal acts.

###Less crime, or more?
If we required every transaction to be detailed with the nature and purpose, along with the identities to reduce crime, it may save lives - but at what cost?

The regulations around knowing your customer currently only apply to financial services businesses because they deal with large amounts of money. If every bank checked what the purpose was for every transaction (large or small), many people will get a lot more questions about their daily shopping activities.

>'You bought this tablet just for yourself?'
>
>'Yes.'
>
>'Okay, make sure to register any family members or friends who do any online shopping on it with us.'

This example is kind of exaggerated and I hope it never gets anywhere close to this but it shows how complete knowledge of a customer's activities might engender a mutual distrust.

####Have you ever bought bitcoins?
In case you haven't experienced buying bitcoins yet, try using your bank account and see if you receive a phone call from your bank inquiring about the reason why you are buying them. You can tell them you were just trying it to see if they would check up on your transactions!

###Less fraud (because banks have everything under control)
When I was scammed buying a phone on the Internet I thought:

>Everything will be okay, my bank has a fraud department and a money back guarantee! I remember from the TV advert.

But banks have a *very* different definition of fraud to what most consumers have.

As a consumer, you expect that when someone uses their bank account to scam you - banks will act to protect you. Here is the catch of bank's fraud protection:

>You didnâ€™t contribute to the loss

So if you send money to a bank account, that is contributing to the loss and there is no protection for that loss.

In a world without cash and more dependability on banking services, I expect there'd be the same level or more fraud because scammers will spend their ill gotten gains ASAP anyway, leaving a merchant somewhere at a loss if the transaction is reversed.

###More tax collected
If everyone was forced to use a government monitored stored value account, nobody could possible avoid paying tax. This is just a recipe for disaster. Paying tax not only supports schools, hospitals and police - it also supports political corruption, corporations (who usually don't pay tax anyway), propaganda, cronyism, inequality and most disgustingly, large scale wars.

There are much better ways to support schools, hospitals and police than collecting taxes, one idea is to actually give them money, voluntarily! Relying on subsidies is an unworkable and corruptible practice that needs to cease now.

###Illicit drugs
The war on drugs has to be one of the most successful government propaganda stories ever told. Not only was the most popular drug at the time;marijuana, made illegal [without due process](http://www.drugwarrant.com/articles/why-is-marijuana-illegal/) - it has very many [medicinal benefits](http://www.businessinsider.com/health-benefits-of-medical-marijuana-2014-4?op=1) when used in moderation.

And there are many other illicit drugs that can also have [psychological health benefits too](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/health/lsd-reconsidered-for-therapy.html?_r=0) when used in moderation.

###Other illegal acts
If you take away peoples' privacy, control, money and drugs - it really is the best recipe to encourage them to commit other illegal acts to fight 'the system'. The government should treat its citizens like with maturity and respect and not distrust and contempt.

###Isn't Bitcoin anonymous?
No.
