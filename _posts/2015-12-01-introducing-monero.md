*A private crypto-currency with granular-level fungibility; protocol-level mixing* is the one line pitch for relatively new crypto-currency Monero.

### Bitcoin

Bitcoin is a liberating tool and extremely interesting social experiment in money. However, it has some shortcomings as a medium of exchange.

* Full traceability is bad news for proprietary businesses that hold their business volume as a trade secret
* Change addresses confuse new users
* People seeking privacy must mix coins, losing value in fees or fraud
* Fungibility is bad - exchanges can confiscate your bitcoins if they suspect they were involved in criminal transactions
