Bitcoin - A Brief Background
---------------

Many people have heard of Bitcoin, yet not many people know what it really is or how to use it.
Bitcoin is a crypto-currency – a currency that exists online.

For many people the main attracting feature of Bitcoin is that it can be somewhat anonymous. Since most desktop Bitcoin wallets don’t require registration, very few people can trace your transactions back to you. You can also create as many addresses as you want.

Bitcoin can’t be counterfeited. All Bitcoin transactions are logged in the Blockchain, which is viewable by anyone. The Blockchain shows how much Bitcoin was sent to each address and who sent it there.

When you send bitcoins to someone, the miners (computers running software that validates transactions) validate that you have control over the bitcoins that you’re sending and that the bitcoins you’re sending exist. With all of these components, you have a pretty solid foundation for a currency.

Bitcoin has real-world applications, too. [Some companies](https://www.wagecan.com) have made Bitcoin debit cards that draws from your Bitcoin wallet and converts your bitcoins to spendable cash. Some businesses have started to accept Bitcoin by having customers scan QR codes with their wallet apps.

##Alternative coins
This is where the alternative coins come in to play. So many people saw that Bitcoin was growing and they wanted their share. Alt-coins are coins (typically forks of Bitcoin) that are different from bitcoin.

Enter Monero. Monero is an alt-coin that is based on privacy. Transactions are piled together with other people’s transactions, which makes it both unlinkable and untraceable.

In Bitcoin, people are encouraged to make a new Bitcoin address for each transaction which makes their transactions more difficult to link. However, most people using Bitcoin don't do this and in fact reuse the same address for many different payments. This makes Bitcoin much easier to link identities and trace payments.

People who follow the recommended practice of making a new address for each payment can still have their transactions traced when they spend bitcoins from the same wallet that contain multiple addresses, all addresses are used simultaneously and a strong link can be established.

Untraceable means that even the recipient has no idea where the payment came from. Monero piles many different transactions together automatically, making them untraceable. Nobody knows who you’re sending coins to and how many coins are in any one person's address.

Getting Started in Crypto-Currency
------------------------
Now that you know what Bitcoin is and how it works, we can get started.
There are several ways to get coins, here are the main ones:

1. Buying them
2. Mining for them
3. Hitting up the Bitcoin faucets

###Buying
This is the simplest option you’ve got. There are several places to buy from, with [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/leotreasure) being my favorite. They have a special deal where if you click that link and buy $100 of bitcoins, you get an extra 10%! Coinbase is also a wallet (also my personal favorite, there’s no fees). The Bitcoin market changes on a day to day basis, so I recommend buying while the Bitcoin market is weak. That’s the easiest option.

###Mining
This is probably the most complicated option there is. At this point, Bitcoin is so difficult to mine, you’ll need a "mining rig" to get anything. (Mining rigs are computers made custom just for mining cryptocurrencies.) I won’t get too in depth with this. Basically, miners solve difficult algorithms while validating transactions. If you want to mine, just search for 'Bitcoin mining pools' and looks for directions, because each pool has different recommendations for setups.

###Fauceteering
My own made up word for what I do *all the time*. There are many, many websites out there that display an amazing amount of ads (so many that you can’t believe how there’s room for anything else), and in exchange for going to that site, you get free bitcoins. Not much, but it adds up (eventually). This is how I got started, and how I recommend you get started. You can find my personally approved list of faucets here. [List of faucets](http://www.writeurl.com/text/dnrcaa6a1w3q3bvbd4bu/81g4zd4spcs4mutrq5rv)

###Gambling
The kind of frowned upon way. I personally don’t like this method. This wasn’t included in the main ways to get Bitcoin for a reason. There are sites that you can spend Bitcoin and play a hi-low game, sometimes winning a ton of money, sometimes losing a ton of money. To find Bitcoin gambling sites just go to a faucet, you’ll find tons of ads for them. Or of course there are also gambling sites specifically for Monero, like [MoneroDice](http://monerodice.net) and [SafeDice](http://safedice.com). Please use them at your own risk and don’t lose all of your money to a game.

Getting Started with Monero
---------------------------
There are two ways to get started with Monero. There aren’t many faucets yet, so you’re pretty much limited to either buying or mining.
##Buying Monero
You aren’t really going to find many places to buy Monero for cash. The easiest way to get some Monero is to first buy some of (almost) any cryptocurrency, most likely Bitcoin or Litecoin. Then, you go to [shapeshift.io](https://shapeshift.io). ShapeShift is a website that will convert (almost) any cryptocurrency, with no account required.

###Mining Monero
Mining Monero isn’t *nearly* as hard as mining Bitcoin, but is still a complicated process. With Monero, you can use a personal computer to mine still, but you won’t get as fast as dedicated mining rigs out there. Personally, I suggest using the Yam client with the [MoneroPool](https://moneropool.com/) mining pool. [Instructions for download and setup are on their website](https://moneropool.com/#getting_started).

Monero isn’t a very big currency... yet. I think it’s a really cool concept, it just needs to be used. So, please, by all means, start using Monero. It’s great for privacy conscious people who want to stay safe on the Internet.

**NOTE: monero.org is *not* the official Monero website. [getmonero.org](https://getmonero.org) is the official website!**

All in all, crypto-currencies are a great investment and whichever one you choose to use, you’ll have money to spend online.
