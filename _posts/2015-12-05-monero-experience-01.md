#Using Monero (XMR) is easy

###What Monero is

Monero is a digital crypto-currency based on Crypto-note technology. Monero is a safe transaction based currency with some special features such as a payment address and a payment ID. The Crypto-note is the basis on how this currency is mined.

###My experience

My experience with Monero (XMR) was really a positive one knowing that this type of digital currency had not only a payment address, but also a payment ID. This was easy for me to understand since it was a direct comparison to any normal bank account with a transit number and an account number. The one thing that was a great security was in order to use a digital currency exchange web site, you would have to enter both the payment address, and the payment ID to be sure only you received the Monero.  Using Monero (XMR) was very easy, as is using any of the other Digital Currencies, with one exception, Monero is a more secure transaction.

Monero digital currency is valued at approximately $0.38 USD. At present, Monero can be used in the entertainment of online casinos. Hopefully, in the future, there will be more markets to spend Monero so there is less fees in exchanging Monero to another currency.

###Getting started
The first thing I did was to download the Monero Digital Wallet from [getmonero.org](https://getmonero.org).  Downloading the wallet and installing was simple, as I have used many digital currencies to date.  The setup program for the digital wallet was simple, and really did not take that much thought to install for me.  After I have set up the wallet, which was easy, the next step was to get the right program to start mining Monero.

###Mining For Monero.

Mining Monero I found to be very easy, with no confusing codes or .bat files to type. The easiest program I found was Minergate. Minergate can be downloaded from [www.minergate.com](https://www.minergate.com). This program allowed me to use my two computers with quad four processors (4 CPU cores). Using Minergate allowed me to mine Monero as well as a bonus coin on one computer, as well as mining Bytecoin (BCN) and the bonus coin on the second one.

The Minergate program has a built in wallet to store the Monero and other coins mined, this makes it easier to send the coins in bulk to your wallet or exchange web site. It has been my experience that depending on what type of computer you have, or if you are CPU mining or GPU mining, makes a difference on how long it will take to get results. Even though I was CPU mining I did have results fast. The Monero was partial coins, but that was not really bad, since after only a week I had a few thousand Bytecoins (BCN) that I send to a web based exchange and exchanged them for Monero.

Since Bytecoin came in very fast and more frequently I opened up an exchange site at [poloniex.com](https://poloniex.com). This allowed me to send my Bytecoins to the exchange and trade them for Monero very quickly. I did not have any long delays and the Monero was in my Poloniex account within minutes. Monero is also a very easy currency to use, because it is able to be traded to many other currencies rapidly as well.


###Things to be aware of

Just like any other site that you want information on always be sure to go to the official sites. With Monero the official site is [getmonero.org](https://getmonero.org). Do not use any other site that looks similar, you will only be disappointed.


To sum it up Monero can be obtained through mining and can be used to play in a few entertainment online casino sites. I have found that trading Monero is by far easier than you think. I have had an easy time mining and using Monero.
